# Soft Delete


```go
import "gorm.io/plugin/soft_delete"

type User struct {
  ID        uint
  Name      string
  DeletedAt soft_delete.DeletedAt
}

// Query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE deleted_at = 0;

// Delete
UPDATE users SET deleted_at = /* current unix second */ WHERE ID = 1;
```

### Specify Time Unit

We now support ms and ns timestamp when filling the `deleted_at` col, only need to specify tag `gorm:"softDelete:milli"` or `gorm:"softDelete:nano"`.

```go
type User struct {
  ID    uint
  Name  string
  DeletedAt soft_delete.DeletedAt `gorm:"softDelete:milli"`
  // DeletedAt soft_delete.DeletedAt `gorm:"softDelete:nano"`
}

// Query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE deleted_at = 0;

// Delete
UPDATE users SET deleted_at = /* current unix milli second or nano second */ WHERE ID = 1;
```

## Flag Mode

flag mode will use `0`, `1` to mark data as deleted or not, `1` means deleted

```go
type User struct {
  ID    uint
  Name  string
  IsDel soft_delete.DeletedAt `gorm:"softDelete:flag"`
}

// Query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE is_del = 0;

// Delete
UPDATE users SET is_del = 1 WHERE ID = 1;
```


## Mixed Mode

mixed mode will use `0`, `1` to mark data as deleted or not, `1` means deleted, and store delete time

```go
type User struct {
  ID        uint
  Name      string
  DeletedAt time.Time
  IsDel     soft_delete.DeletedAt `gorm:"softDelete:flag,DeletedAtField:DeletedAt"`
}

// Query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE is_del = 0;

// Delete
UPDATE users SET is_del = 1, deleted_at = /* current unix second */ WHERE ID = 1;
```
